## Profile Card Front-End Challenge
This project is a simple Profile Card created as part of a front-end challenge I found on Dev.to. The purpose of this project is to practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills.

## Overview
This Profile Card features a clean and minimalistic design, showcasing basic information such as a profile picture, name, and links to social media accounts. Visitors can easily connect with me on LinkedIn and Twitter by clicking the provided buttons.

## Technologies Used
** HTML5: For structuring the content of the Profile Card.
** CSS3: For styling the Profile Card, including layout, colors, and typography.

## Live Demo

## Future Improvements
As a beginner, I acknowledge that this project is not perfect. I plan to:
** Refactor and optimize the code for better readability and efficiency.
** Enhance the design by adding responsive elements for better mobile viewing.
** Experiment with CSS animations to make the card more interactive.
